## University Of Liverpool - [Naga sri ram Kochetti] [201664307] 
This repository is dedicated to the advancement of autonomous vehicle safety through the application of dense reinforcement learning. Leveraging the power of the highway-env environment, our goal is to create a robust validation framework that ensures the safety of autonomous vehicles under a wide range of driving scenarios.
# Safety in Autonomous Driving using Dense Deep Reinforcement Learning with Highway-env

## Description
This repository focuses on improving the safety of autonomous vehicles through the application of dense deep reinforcement learning. By harnessing the capabilities of the `highway-env` environment, our project aims to establish a robust safety validation framework to assess the performance of autonomous vehicles in diverse driving scenarios.
